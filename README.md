# HsWfHelper

## How to run

Requires an ".env" file in the same directory as the ".py" file with two lines containing api keys (one for the portal of origin, and one for the destination portal):

`HAPIKEY_ORIGIN=f******d-2**v-4**5-9**3-7**********d`

`HAPIKEY_TARGET=6******5-3**2-4**4-b**1-***********4`

Tested on Python 3.8.6.

*THE DESTIONATION PORTAL MUST BE A TEST PORTAL* (as this script currently produces a lot of placeholders and is not ready for serious use)
